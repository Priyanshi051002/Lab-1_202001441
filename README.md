Q1. Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

Functional Requirements:

1. Login to use the features of a member of LIS: If a user wants to issue any book, he needs to be the member first. So the user must sign up or login with his/her proper credentials.

2. Issue/Return a book: A user can issue a book he/she wants if it is available at that moment. The user can issue it for a specified amount of time. He/She can extend the issuing period to any other date if the particular book is available and no other issues are done for that book till that date.

4.The interface should be easy to understand for the users and self explanatory.




Q2. Identify Scope, Features and Non Functional aspects of the following problem:

Scope:

The app should be able to identify key sound events like car horns, bell rings, door knocks, phone rings, fire alarms, animals and babies crying sounds etc. As a response to this, it should be able to replicate it with  flash signals and vibrations in a real time environment.

Features:

2. Users can only stop the alert (can be done by password, fingerprint, etc).

3. The alert should not stop until the user stops it.

Non-Functional Aspects:

1. The app should be able to handle as much as 5% of the total population at a time.

2. The response time of the app should be very quick so that it can be used in real time.

3. App should identify the sounds precisely and notify the users accordingly.

4. The settings can be modified by the user only.
